  
/assets/ReadMe.txt
------------------
Place your asset files in this 'assets' folder, and use "fopen" to access.
This will be your current working directory on Windows, Linux and Android.
On Android, the contents of this folder will be included in your APK file.
Internally, 'fopen' uses AssetManager, so files in this folder are read-only.
